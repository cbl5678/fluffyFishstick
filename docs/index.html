                    Quark Magazine Issues they had written and other works each author did that was

                </h3>
                <p>For this project, we had to write up two separate schemas. This was due to the
                    complexity of the two types of XML markup we had wrote. We markedup the
                    "Contributor Lists" and the "Speculative Fiction" chapters in each issue. This
                    allowed us to use XSLT to pull specific information from both types of markup
                    files. </p>

                <p>With our XSLT we wanted to pull contributors names, places, and the issues of
                    "Quark" each author contributed to. With that information we built a table that
                    represented each individual author and information pertaining to them like their
                    birth and death dates, as well as a short bio, and other works they have written
                    that was mention in the issues of "Quark." </p>
                <p>XSLT was also used to pull locations from our markup documents and mark them on
                    an interactive map using JavaScript. This was with the help of Dr.
                    Beshero-Bondar, our Digital Humanities teacher.</p>

                                this took time and patience, but I am please with how everything

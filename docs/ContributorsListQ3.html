               Constellations of the Inner Eye (1961), Carrying What You Love (1966), and other
               volumes of poetry. She moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1986, publishing once again
               under her maiden name, and died there at eighty. Dorman's recognition from the
               science fiction community includes a 1978 Science Fiction Poetry Association
               Rhysling Award for "The Corruption of Metals", and a 1995 James Tiptree, Jr.
               retroactive award for "When I Was Miss Dow" (1963, reprinted in Galaxy 1966).</td>

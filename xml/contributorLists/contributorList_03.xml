            <desc>Dorman published approximately two dozen science fiction stories between 1961 and

                also published fiction in <title>The Saturday Evening Post</title>, <title>Redbook</title>, and other
                nonspecialist magazines. Dorman was particularly associated with science fiction's
                "New Wave" of edgy, experimental writing and indeed, her short story "Go, Go, Go,
                Said the Bird" was featured in Harlan Ellison's groundbreaking <title>Dangerous Visions</title>
                anthology (1967). Her experimental novel <title>Onyx</title> was rejected by publishers in 1971,
                but her collected <title>Poems</title> appeared in 1970, followed by <title>Palace of Earth</title> (1984),
                <title>Constellations of the Inner Eye</title> (1961), <title>Carrying What You Love</title> (1966), and other
                volumes of poetry. She moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1986, publishing once again
                under her maiden name, and died there at eighty. Dorman's recognition from the
                science fiction community includes a 1978 Science Fiction Poetry Association
                Rhysling Award for <title>"The Corruption of Metals"</title>, and a 1995 James Tiptree, Jr.

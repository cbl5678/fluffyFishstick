                Said the Bird" was featured in Harlan Ellison's groundbreaking Dangerous Visions
                anthology (1967). Her experimental novel Onyx was rejected by publishers in 1971,

                Constellations of the Inner Eye (1991), Carrying What You Love (1996), and other
                volumes of poetry. She moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1986, publishing once again
                under her maiden name, and died there at eighty. Dorman's recognition from the
                science fiction community includes a 1978 Science Fiction Poetry Association
                Rhysling Award for "The Corruption of Metals," and a 1995 James Tiptree, Jr.

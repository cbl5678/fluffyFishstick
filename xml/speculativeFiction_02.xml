    <title>speculative fiction</title>
    <p>All fiction is speculative.</p>
    <p>Its tools are words, and its building process is human thought or imagination. Its point of
        view is the distorting glass of the writer's mind.</p>
    <p>The world, this haphazard creation of our conglomerate consciousness, this Grand Old Place
        that may roll on without us, is more unlikely than any novelist's nightmare or wetdream.
        Humanity is, within boundaries, predictable. Creative imagination is, savingly, one thing we
        can humanly predict will define, and even exceed, those boundaries.</p>
    <p>This is a tribute to imagination, an invocation of the possible, as grim as headlines, as
        gorgeous as invention.</p>
    <p>This is a quarterly of speculative fiction.</p>
